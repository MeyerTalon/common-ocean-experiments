## Getting Started
Create a new Anaconda environment for Python 3.8:

```bash
conda create âˆ’n foo python=3.8
conda activate foo
```

Install the packages outlines in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Research Questions

- Reinforcement learning model (current favorite) vs rule based model vs some secret third option?
- For an RL model, do we output the complete trajectory given an input state or output $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ the control input at each time step? Or a combination of both?
- How do we integrate the model with the CommonOcean-IO framework?
- For scenario generation, do we want to use/train on one set scenario, or any randomly generated scenario within the a given scenario bounds?
- How do we randomly generate a scenario?


## Implementation Details

**Three Degrees of Freedom Model**

State of the ego vessel at time $t$ is $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$.


**Note to self:** Keep the model simple, should output the
